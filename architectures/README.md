# Architectures

The deep-climate-emulator package expects a JSON file defining the DNN
architecture as well as the hyperparameters used during training. Here we
provide two example files containing the architecture definition for our best
residual network (```18-layer-ResNet_architecture.json```) and the
hyperparameters used during training
(```18-layer-ResNet_hyperparameters.json```). These files can be used with the
script ```trainer.py``` to approximately reproduce our results.

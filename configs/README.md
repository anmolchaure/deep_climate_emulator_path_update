# Configs

The deep-climate-emulator package expects two config files: 
1. A JSON file defining the DNN architecture.  
2. A JSON file defining the hyperparameters used during training.

Here we provide two example files containing the architecture definition for our
best residual network (```18-layer-ResNet_architecture.json```) and the
hyperparameters used during training
(```18-layer-ResNet_hyperparameters.json```). These files can be used with the
script ```trainer.py``` to approximately reproduce our results.
